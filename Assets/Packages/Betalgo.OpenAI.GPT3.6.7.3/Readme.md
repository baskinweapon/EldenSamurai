Visit https://openai.com/ to get your API key. Also documentation with more detail is avaliable there.  

## Sample Usages
The repository contains a sample project named **OpenAI.Playground** that you can refer to for a better understanding of how the library works. However, please exercise caution while experimenting with it, as some of the test methods may result in unintended consequences such as file deletion or fine tuning.


### ***!! It is highly recommended that you use a separate account instead of your primary account while using the playground. This is because some test methods may add or delete your files and models, which could potentially cause unwanted issues. !!***

Your API Key comes from here --> https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys

Your Organization ID comes from here --> https://platform.openai.com/account/org-settings

### Without using dependency injection:
```csharp
var openAiService = new OpenAIService(new OpenAiOptions()
{
    ApiKey =  Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MY_OPEN_AI_API_KEY")
});
```
### Using dependency injection:
#### secrets.json: 

```csharp
 "OpenAIServiceOptions": {
    //"ApiKey":"Your api key goes here"
    //,"Organization": "Your Organization Id goes here (optional)"
  },
```
*(How to use [user secret](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/aspnet/core/security/app-secrets?view=aspnetcore-6.0&tabs=windows) ?  
Right click your project name in "solution explorer" then click "Manage User Secret", it is a good way to keep your api keys)*

#### Program.cs
```csharp
serviceCollection.AddOpenAIService();
```

**OR**  
Use it like below but do NOT put your API key directly to your source code. 
#### Program.cs
```csharp
serviceCollection.AddOpenAIService(settings => { settings.ApiKey = Environment.GetEnvironmentVariable("MY_OPEN_AI_API_KEY"); });
```

After injecting your service you will be able to get it from service provider
```csharp
var openAiService = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService<IOpenAIService>();
```

You can set default model(optional):
```csharp
openAiService.SetDefaultModelId(Models.Davinci);
```
## Chat Gpt Sample
```csharp
var completionResult = await openAiService.ChatCompletion.CreateCompletion(new ChatCompletionCreateRequest
{
    Messages = new List<ChatMessage>
    {
        ChatMessage.FromSystem("You are a helpful assistant."),
        ChatMessage.FromUser("Who won the world series in 2020?"),
        ChatMessage.FromAssistant("The Los Angeles Dodgers won the World Series in 2020."),
        ChatMessage.FromUser("Where was it played?")
    },
    Model = Models.ChatGpt3_5Turbo,
    MaxTokens = 50//optional
});
if (completionResult.Successful)
{
   Console.WriteLine(completionResult.Choices.First().Message.Content);
}
```
## Completions Sample
```csharp
var completionResult = await openAiService.Completions.CreateCompletion(new CompletionCreateRequest()
{
    Prompt = "Once upon a time",
    Model = Models.TextDavinciV3
});

if (completionResult.Successful)
{
    Console.WriteLine(completionResult.Choices.FirstOrDefault());
}
else
{
    if (completionResult.Error == null)
    {
        throw new Exception("Unknown Error");
    }
    Console.WriteLine($"{completionResult.Error.Code}: {completionResult.Error.Message}");
}
```

## Completions Stream Sample
```csharp
var completionResult = openAiService.Completions.CreateCompletionAsStream(new CompletionCreateRequest()
   {
      Prompt = "Once upon a time",
      MaxTokens = 50
   }, Models.Davinci);

   await foreach (var completion in completionResult)
   {
      if (completion.Successful)
      {
         Console.Write(completion.Choices.FirstOrDefault()?.Text);
      }
      else
      {
         if (completion.Error == null)
         {
            throw new Exception("Unknown Error");
         }

         Console.WriteLine($"{completion.Error.Code}: {completion.Error.Message}");
      }
   }
   Console.WriteLine("Complete");
```

## DALL路E Sample
```csharp
var imageResult = await openAiService.Image.CreateImage(new ImageCreateRequest
{
    Prompt = "Laser cat eyes",
    N = 2,
    Size = StaticValues.ImageStatics.Size.Size256,
    ResponseFormat = StaticValues.ImageStatics.ResponseFormat.Url,
    User = "TestUser"
});


if (imageResult.Successful)
{
    Console.WriteLine(string.Join("\n", imageResult.Results.Select(r => r.Url)));
}
```

## Notes:
Please note that due to time constraints, I was unable to thoroughly test all of the methods or fully document the library. If you encounter any issues, please do not hesitate to report them or submit a pull request - your contributions are always appreciated.

I initially developed this SDK for my personal use and later decided to share it with the community. As I have not maintained any open-source projects before, any assistance or feedback would be greatly appreciated. If you would like to contribute in any way, please feel free to reach out to me with your suggestions.

I will always be using the latest libraries, and future releases will frequently include breaking changes. Please take this into consideration before deciding to use the library. I want to make it clear that I cannot accept any responsibility for any damage caused by using the library. If you feel that this is not suitable for your purposes, you are free to explore alternative libraries or the OpenAI Web-API.
